# VSCode

Like most, I :heart: VSCode.  I want to dive in as much as I can.  But I'm still not used to the keybindings.  Questions that I have include:

1. Are there editor koans for learning VSCode?
2. Can I change the plugins used on a per project or per top level directory way?  Sort of an rvm/nvm for VSCode?  Perhaps [workspace settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings) can be used for this?
3. Anyone want to be my [live share buddy](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/11/15/live-share)?   Maybe we could pair on some [Exercism.io](https://exercism.io/) or something...  Random google results suggest [ways to organize Exercism.io problems with VSCode](https://github.com/rprouse/Exercism.VisualStudio)
4. I've mostly used VSCode with Angular 5/6 applications.   What have you used it with, please?

# VIM

1. Vim (or at least vi) is everywhere.  There are also vim plugins almost everywhere...
2. Chad wants to distribute .vimrc and friends with [yadm](https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm).  I don't bother, yet.
3. [Fuzzy Finder](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
4. I'd like to switch from vim haphazard to vimrific via [vim zero](https://www.oliversherouse.com/2017/08/21/vim_zero.html).
5. In March 2018 I followed two [blog posts](https://medium.com/@mhartington/typescript-vim-64783d89e468), one of which is now gone to setup:

    a. [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.Vim) -- A bundler that worked, quickly

    b. [typescript-vim](https://github.com/leafgarland/typescript-vim) -- syntax highlighting
    
    c. [YouCompleteMe](http://valloric.github.io/YouCompleteMe/) -- code completion engine
    
    d. [ale](https://github.com/w0rp/ale) -- Asynchronous linting/fixing for Vim and Language Server Protocol (LSP) integration
    
    e. [tsuquyomi](https://github.com/Quramy/tsuquyomi) -- Make vim a TypeScript IDE


# mosh & tmux
Using `mosh 54lunch.com tmux` is nice because, at my house, there are short Internet outages.  Those happen when I'm in other places, too.   There are many [blog posts on setting up mosh & tmux]( https://blog.filippo.io/my-remote-shell-session-setup/).   I don't use iTerm integration because I switch between Mac, Chromebook, and Windows10.

For my linode box, I use a `.tmux.conf` that turns the status bar blue.    Locally, the tmux status bar is green.  It's easy to tell the difference.

## .tmux.conf - Having a clock and distinct status bar is easy

```
set -g history-limit 30000
set -g status-right '#(TZ=US/Central date)'
set -g status-style bg=blue
```
