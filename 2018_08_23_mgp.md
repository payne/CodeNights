# VIM
1. It's everywhere
2. Chad wants to distribute .vimrc and friends with yadm[f].  I don't bother, yet.
3. Fuzzy Finder[g]
4. I'd like to switch from vim haphazard to vimrific via vim zero[h].
5. In March 2018 I followed two blog posts[d,e], one of which is now gone to setup
    a. Vundle -- A bundler that worked, quickly
    b. typescript-vim -- syntax highlighting
    c. YouCompleteMe -- code completion engine
    d. ale -- Asynchronous linting/fixing for Vim and Language Server Protocol (LSP) integration
    e. tsuquyomi -- Make vim a TypeScript IDE



# mosh & tmux
Using `mosh 54lunch.com tmux` is nice because, at my house, there are short Internet outages.  Those happen when I'm in other places, too.  Having a clock and distinct status bar is easy[x].
