# VIM

1. Vim (or at least vi) is everywhere.
2. Chad wants to distribute .vimrc and friends with [yadm](https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm).  I don't bother, yet.
3. [Fuzzy Finder](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
4. I'd like to switch from vim haphazard to vimrific via [vim zero](https://www.oliversherouse.com/2017/08/21/vim_zero.html).
5. In March 2018 I followed two blog posts[d,e], one of which is now gone to setup

    a. [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.Vim) -- A bundler that worked, quickly
    b. [typescript-vim](https://github.com/leafgarland/typescript-vim) -- syntax highlighting
    c. [YouCompleteMe](http://valloric.github.io/YouCompleteMe/) -- code completion engine
    d. [ale](https://github.com/w0rp/ale) -- Asynchronous linting/fixing for Vim and Language Server Protocol (LSP) integration
    e. [tsuquyomi](https://github.com/Quramy/tsuquyomi) -- Make vim a TypeScript IDE



# mosh & tmux
Using `mosh 54lunch.com tmux` is nice because, at my house, there are short Internet outages.  Those happen when I'm in other places, too.  Having a clock and distinct status bar is easy[x].  There are many [blog posts on setting up mosh & tmux]( https://blog.filippo.io/my-remote-shell-session-setup/).



## [x] Simple .tmux.conf
```
set -g history-limit 30000
set -g status-right '#(TZ=US/Central date)'
set -g status-style bg=blue
```
